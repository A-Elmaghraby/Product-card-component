### Built with

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive layouts. I also improved my understanding of semantic HTML5 markup and how to implement a mobile-first workflow.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills, particularly in the areas of asynchronous programming and API integration. Additionally, I plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques and frameworks to enhance the design and responsiveness of my web applications.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand Flexbox and how to use it to create responsive layouts.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
